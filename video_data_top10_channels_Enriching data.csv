Hi everyone, in today's video we'll be talking about working with private and sensitive data. A lot of times data scientists do not work on the most valuable and ""cool"" datasets, simply because these datasets contain too sensitive individual information. I have encountered this many times at my work, and it's frustrating! In this video, I will give you a brief introduction to different techniques for handling senstive data, and how to implement them using Antigranular platform. 

Thank you for watching! 😇

Hi everyone, in today's video I'm making a deepdive into how to use generative AI tools inside Jupyter Notebook 🤩. These tools can help you speed up the data wrangling and explorative analysis process, and let you focus on the more important analyses. However, these tools are not (yet) perfect and there are several concerns, which I also discussed later in the video. Hope this video is helpful! Thank you for watching 😇.

Honestly, I feel a bit restless these days by the recent AI developments. It is very exciting and terrifying at the same time. Hence, I dove into this topic and did some research, with the hope to understand a bit better what's going on. AI risks are sometimes so conceptual and hard to put into words. So I hope this video will give you a glimpse of the discussions around these difficult topics and what still needs to be done to help make AI really benefit humans, instead of doing harm. 

Hope you enjoyed the vid! 🤗

Hi data nerds! 👋 Data visualization and storytelling make an interesting part of a data analyst/ data scientist's job. In today’s video, I’ll be walking you through some of the worst (and common) mistakes in data visualization I have encountered in my career. Designing an effective data visualization needs both art and science (perhaps more art than you would like to admit). With this video, I hope to help you avoid the most important mistakes that you might encounter daily at work, and how not to be fooled by those 😉.

I hope you enjoy this video 😄. Let me know if I missed any important mistakes in the comment below 👇

Hi data nerds! 👋 In today’s video, I’ll be walking you through a project to analyse data science books using Deepnote. I think this is a fun project to work on to both sharpen our skills on multiple levels, and to get to know more about data science books available in the market. We’ll be doing exploratory data analysis, clustering book titles to find out the common themes, and finally scraping Amazon reviews and summarising the reviews for each book.

I hope you enjoy this video 😄.

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video I'm talking about how I use iPad Pro for learning data science. I really enjoy watching videos, reading books, taking study notes and even coding (!) on an iPad. Honestly, I tend to get lazy and procrastinate a lot when working/ studying by myself. This iPad has helped me against procrastination because I actually think it is fun to use it. Even though it costs a lot of money (to me), I still think it's been a great investment overall. 

Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, greetings from my hometown in Vietnam!! JupyterLab is a great tool for data science, but it has its own limitations.. big ones 😅.. Due to the fact that you can execute cells in different orders, it's easy to make mistakes and mess up the output. From my experience, it could be a big challenge to use JupyterLab in a complex data science project. In this video, I'm sharing with you about Link, a JupyterLab extension that helps us easily create pipelines in JupyterLab and share them with other people. This extension helps address the reproducibility issue of JupyterLab, and makes it easy to share results. While walking you through the how-to of this extension, I also tried to give a brief introduction to neural style transfer algorithm, which is what I implemented in this sample notebook. 

Let me know what you think about this extension and whether you would consider using it in your projects. Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video we are going to talk about automatic speech recognition (ASR) and build an audio content analyzer dashboard using AssemblyAI's API and Panel. There are a lot of useful things you can do with speech recognition (that are actually more useful than this 😅). With this audio visualization app, I hope to inspire you to create a fun project for your own portfolio using APIs! And hope you enjoyed watching it too!

Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video I'm talking about my online bachelors in Computer Science degree. I'm happy to finally put this video out because many of you are curious about it. And, if the recession is indeed coming, what's the better way to prepare for the future than going back to school to study something useful 😉🤓. I'll be going over an overview of the program, the duration and time commitment. Then I'll drill down into the curriculum of each year and give you an overview of the main topics I learned in the modules. I realized it was very hard to cover everything, but hope this video gives you an insider look into the program and see if it fits your needs. 

Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video we made an attempt to extract relationships between The Witcher's characters from the books. We also did some graph analyses (centrality measures and community detection) and visualization using NetworkX and Pyvis. The analyses are still quite preliminary and I might have glossed over some details, but hopefully, this is a bit interesting and you learned something from it 🤓. This is the second project in the Witcher project series where we will analyze the relationships between characters. The next episode of this series will be all about network graph visualization 😁. I hope you enjoyed this video and any questions and thoughts are welcome! Thank you for watching 🙌🏽

What's up, everyone! In today's video, I'll talk about some of the skills that online data science/ data analytics courses often don't teach you. After a few years of being in the field, I feel like there are a lot of useful skills and techniques that are often covered so briefly or completely overlooked by the recently introduced online certificates. With this video, I hope to introduce you to some of the blind spots and missing pieces that could be helpful to you in your journey of becoming a data analyst or entry-level data scientist. Hope you enjoyed this video and thank you for watching! 👋

What's up, everyone! So today's video is a bit different from my normal talking-head/ tutorial style, attempting to teach you something about data science :). I've been thinking about making this video for a while, as I'm nearing the end of my study. As you probably noticed in some of my older videos I mentioned my BSc Computer Science study next to work, and that's what this video is all about :). I'm sharing here my story of how I came to do that, my motivation, strategies, and some fun demos of what I have created during my study. I hope you found this video entertaining and somewhat informative ;). And, don't forget to check out the nerdy gifts at the end of the video! ;) Thank you for watching!

Today we look at some SQL Interview Questions. The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

AI is the hottest topic right now. And AI tools are being developed for all areas, including different IT fields. And since you are on the TechWorld with Nana channel, we will be talking about the AI tools specifically for DevOps and Cloud use cases.

To make it more interesting and valuable for you, I decided to focus on categories of AI tools, like monitoring, security instead of just comparing random or most popular AI tools. 

Plus I’m gonna give you my honest experience of using these tools in my actual DevOps projects and explain why I’m not the biggest fan of AI tools right now.

▬▬▬▬▬▬  ▬▬▬▬▬▬  ▬▬▬▬▬▬  ▬▬▬▬▬▬  ▬▬▬▬▬▬  

I created a tutorial specifically for developers, who NEVER REALLY understood the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) properly😌 what it is about and why it's so important for application development 🚀


Back then, when I was a software engineer, I remember us developers never wanted to work with Jenkins jobs or deal with anything related to release pipelines.

It was the task of the senior engineers dedicated to it 🙉

Later in my career when I slowly moved to DevOps, I realized that if someone had explained to me properly with simple words, why I, as a software developer should know about CI and CD, how it affects my work, it would have been extremely helpful for my job. 

Plus broken down in simple terms, it's really easy to understand. And that's why I created this tutorial, to save anyone years of just vaguely understanding this important concept or having a fear of working with it 💪

If you have struggled with understanding or working with Continuous Integration, I promise, by the end of this video, you will feel like a pro 🙌 about this concept and will wanna learn even more, for which I have even more easy to learn resources to make you a pro in the whole DevOps and Cloud world 😊

But start with this tutorial first, where you'll learn:

💡 What Continuous Integration (CI) and CI pipeline is exactly
💡 Why we need a CI pipeline in software development projects
💡 Why we need automated tests in different stages
👨🏾‍💻 How to build a CI pipeline in practice that automatically checks your application code quality and automatically suggests fixes

Using GitHub Actions as CI server and JetBrains Qodana for code quality checks 🛠️

Happy learning! 💙

DevSecOps is a set of practices, concepts and tools that combines software development (Dev), security (Sec), and IT operations (Ops) into a single, integrated process. The goal of DevSecOps is to incorporate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle, from design and development to testing and deployment, rather than treating security as a separate and isolated concern.

💜 More infos: https://bit.ly/45mIc6K

▬▬▬▬▬▬  Why DevSecOps is highly demanded💡  ▬▬▬▬▬▬
DevSecOps is the most demanded upcoming skillset needed in the job market.

Why? Security breaches are expected to cost companies trillions annually. So while DevOps solved the automated release of applications, it kind of left out the security, which still remained an afterthought. And to bring security into the DevOps processes and integrate it into every step, DevSecOps concept emerged and is becoming more and more popular.

So as you see, security has a huge impact and importance for companies. And DevSecOps is a key role in implementing security in DevOps processes. That means an engineer equipped with this knowledge is highly valuable for any company that cares about security at all.

▬▬▬▬▬▬  Stand out among co-workers 🏆  ▬▬▬▬▬▬

In this video we're going to talk about a relatively new hot topic in DevOps and Cloud space, which is “platform engineering”. There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.

So let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?

DevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for ""DevOps Cloud Engineer"" or ""Cloud DevOps Engineer"", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role? And that's exactly what I'm going to discuss and clarify in this video.

421,w-X_EQ2Xva4,TechWorld with Nana,Python Automation with ChatGPT,"Python Automation with ChatGPT | Write Python code to connect to OpenAI API and generate automation scripts in seconds!

#python #chatgpt #techworldwithnana 

▬▬▬▬▬▬ PRE-REQUISITES ⏰  ▬▬▬▬▬▬
►  Python Programming Tutorial: https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI
►  ChatGPT Tutorial:                       https://youtu.be/l-kE11fhfaQ

In this video we are going to learn how to use Python to automate things for us so we don't have to do them manually. We're going to automate 2 use cases:
First we will write a Python program that takes any blog article or any web page and it extracts
all the headers from that page or article and then it translates all those headers to Spanish and saves it into its own HTML file so you can open it in the browser and basically see all the headers of that specific blog article translated in Spanish.
In the second use will be that we're going to write a Python program that goes through all the files in our downloads folder it then checks if we have any files that are older than 30 days or were last used
more than 30 days ago and it takes all these files and puts that into a new folder called ""to_delete"" which we can then review and basically delete if needed. So basically it helps us clean up our messy downloads folder with a bunch of old downloaded files in there.

But here's even more interesting thing we will do we will use an artificial intelligence tool that you probably have already heard of a million times called ChatGPT and we will tell Python to use
ChatGPT's API or the underlying API that ChatGPT is also using to generate the Python scripts for those two use cases that I mentioned.

I'm sure you have all heard of ChatGPT by now. It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.

So in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called ""OpenAI"", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.
And then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.
I really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.

We're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.

In this video I want to give you kind of a roadmap of how to get into the IT world. The tech industry is currently one of the hottest industries for the job market, so it's completely logical that so many people are thinking about changing careers to tech or getting into tech just after graduating from school or college.

And it's true that tech industry offers lots of career opportunities, but when you are at the very beginning of your journey it can be very overwhelming too. It is a broad industry with so many options, so many IT fields and professions. There is so much to learn and often you don't even know where to start. It's also hard to know which IT field you will be interested in and will eventually choose, before actually trying things out and seeing for yourself what you enjoy doing the most. You may even have self-doubt thinking that it's too late to switch careers or there's so much to learn you can never catch up with the people, who have been in tech since early age.

And I understand all these concerns, the self-doubt, the time pressure, insecure not knowing where and how to start etc. And that's why with this video I want to kind of show you various career path in tech and give you some general guidance for how to get started. 😊

The most popular IT professions today, that will be even more demanded in the future are: software engineering, DevOps engineering, cloud engineering, cyber security or security engineering, data engineering or generally data related professions and machine learning engineering.

And for every IT field, we will see whether:
- it's an entry-level profession
- what they actually do and what are some of their job responsibilities
- as well as what skills you need to have to get into that specific field 
- and some of the technologies you need to learn for it.

Most of you will probably want to get into one of those fields, but many of you may not know right now what you want to choose exactly, maybe because they all sound equally exciting for you or equally overwhelming so you have no idea which one will be a better choice or which one will be the most interesting one for you, which is absolutely okay, because that's exactly what I want to help you with in this video so let's get into it! ✅

- what are the qualities and characteristics you should have if you want to get into DevOps,
- what kind of thinking and approach is required in DevOps
- which soft skills as well as technical skills you need to have
- and finally what are some challenges of being a DevOps engineer.
- And if at the end of the video you do find out and decide that DevOps is indeed for you, I will also show what next steps you can take to get into DevOps.

In this video we will learn about Azure DevOps. We will see what it is and what you can do with Azure DevOps platform. How to use it for your software development projects and generally how
is this relevant for you as an engineer? We will see different features and use cases of Azure DevOps. How it all works and how you can implement the whole software development and deployment lifecycle with it.
We will also review the Azure DevOps architecture and how it works in the background and finally we will also compare it with alternative tools and talk a bit about which of these tools you need to learn for your career with so many alternative options.

As the name suggests Azure DevOps is a DevOps platform. It is a software as a service offering, which was created to basically be a one-stop shop for implementing all your DevOps processes for your project.

So it's basically a technological implementation of the DevOps process, which covers the whole software development lifecycle and it has features for each part of this lifecycle.
So in this tutorial, we will go through the steps or parts of that software development lifecycle and see how the various Azure DevOps services map to those parts.

In this video I talk about a super important topic, which is security in Kubernetes and what are some of the best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster.

The big challenge that we see in terms of Kubernetes security is that it's already so challenging to set up a Kubernetes cluster and to configure it to deploy the applications in it, that security often becomes the afterthought, adding on top of that already complex configuration. However we can't deny the importance of security, especially when the systems are so complex!

Cloud applications actually become a very attractive target to a lot of hackers and this growing number of cloud native applications mostly use Kubernetes as a platform and that's where the relevance of knowing how to secure Kubernetes clusters comes into play.

In this video, I talk about the challenge of learning multiple technologies and staying up-to-date with new ones in the DevOps field and how I personally manage not to be overwhelmed by it and make the learning process easier.

As a DevOps engineer you need to learn so many tools to even start your job as a Junior DevOps engineer. So the minimum entry requirement is already very high.  But in addition to having to learn 5-10 technologies, this creates another challenge, which is you can’t just learn them in isolation, but you have to know how to combine them too, how to integrate them together to build those processes.

And it doesn’t stop there. To add to this challenge, the DevOps space is developing really fast and we see new technologies, new concepts emerging all the time, so many engineers feel the pressure to learn new tools to use in their projects. So how can you keep an overview and not get too overwhelmed by these, but at the same time still stay up-to-date and know when a new tool comes up that can actually make your work easier, more efficient, or help you and your team in your software development and deployment process.

DevOps has been gaining a lot of popularity and taking over the traditional way of software development. ""DevOps"" term itself is so broad and includes so many things that it became difficult to exactly define it and clearly set the boundaries of DevOps
compared to other IT fields. In this video I'll answer the question of what it is exactly.

So by the end of this video you will REALLY understand what DevOps is and have clarified all your questions around it.
1) First we'll see why is DevOps even needed in the application release process and what are the
challenges in this process that DevOps solves
2) We will talk about what DevOps concept actually is
3) We will also see DevOps as a separate role and how it evolved as well as what are the
tasks and responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer
4) Finally we will briefly talk about Site Reliability Engineering and how SRE fits in the whole DevOps process

438,yyUHQIec83I,TechWorld with Nana,Golang Tutorial for Beginners | Full Go Course,"Full Golang Tutorial to learn the Go Programming Language while building a simple CLI application 

In this full Golang course you will learn about one of the youngest programming languages that is becoming more and more popular in the cloud engineering world, which is Go or also commonly known as Golang. 
You will learn everything you need to get started with Go and start using it in your projects. We're going to write a very simple CLI application to learn the basics of Go. So instead of learning the concepts and syntax of Go with isolated examples, you will learn them while building an actual application throughout the tutorial.

Before diving right into the syntax you will first understand why Go was even developed, its use cases or what Golang is used for and how Go is different from other programming languages.

#redis #database #techworldwithnana

In this Redis crash course, we're going to talk about Redis and how Redis can be used as a primary database for complex applications that need to store data in multiple formats.
1) First we will see what Redis is and its usages as well as why it is suitable for modern complex
microservice applications. 
2) We will talk about how Redis supports storing multiple data formats for different purposes through its modules.
3) Next we will see how Redis as an in-memory database can persist data and recover from data loss.
4) We'll also talk about how Redis optimizes memory storage cost using Redis on Flash.
5) Then we will see very interesting use cases of scaling Redis and replicating it across multiple geographic regions and 
6) finally since one of the most popular platforms for running microservices is Kubernetes and since running stateful applications in Kubernetes is a bit challenging, we will see how you can easily run Redis on Kubernetes.

#kubernetes #k8s #techworldwithnana

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is the most popular platform for container orchestration for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In this complete Kubernetes Tutorial you will learn everything you need to know to get started with Kubernetes in 1 hour. You will learn all the core concepts, including the main Kubernetes components that you need to learn to work efficiently with Kubernetes. You will learn the syntax and contents of K8s configuration file , which is used to create and configure components in a Kubernetes cluster as well as how to setup a K8s cluster locally. Finally, I will show a hands-on demo project, where you will learn how to deploy a web application with its database into a local Kubernetes cluster. It's a simple but realistic application setup, which can also serve as a blueprint configuration for most common application setups.

►  Thanks Datree for sponsoring this video 🙌🏼

In this video we will talk about a tool that helps you prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production, which is called Datree.

Datree lets K8s admins create policies and best practices they want every team to follow, and then run these policies as automated checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline or even earlier in the development workflow as a pre-commit hook for example.

In this video you will learn about an Infrastructure as Code tool, which is gaining popularity in the DevOps world. And that is Pulumi.

First we will see how Pulumi is different to other popular IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible by explaining its main benefits and characteristics. Then I will show how Pulumi actually works in practice by writing a simple Pulumi project to
- first create a S3 bucket in an AWS account and
- then a more realistic example of provisioning an EKS cluster.

Overview of an 8-Hour Ansible Part of a Complete DevOps Educational Program:  ► https://bit.ly/3ODeWEb

It’s a complete guide from beginner to more advanced topics taught via hands-on demo projects. And you don't learn Ansible as a standalone tool in this DevOps bootcamp, but rather integrated in different technologies, like Docker, K8s, Terraform, Jenkins, AWS and so on, in various real world use cases, as it builds on the previous modules in the bootcamp 🔥


▬▬▬▬▬▬ 📚  ANSIBLE MODULE - CURRICULUM OVERVIEW  📚   ▬▬▬▬▬▬ 

CORE CONCEPTS AND SYNTAX OF ANSIBLE:
  ⌨️    Introduction to Ansible
  ⌨️    Install & Configure Ansible
  ⌨️    Setup Managed Server to configure with Ansible
  ⌨️    Ansible Inventory
  ⌨️    Ansible ad-hoc Commands
  ⌨️    Configure AWS EC2 server with Ansible
  ⌨️    Managing Host Key Checking and SSH keys
  ⌨️    Ansible Tasks, Play & Playbook
  ⌨️    Ansible Modules
  ⌨️    Ansible Collections & Ansible Galaxy
  ⌨️    Ansible Variables - to make your Playbook customizable
  ⌨️    Troubleshooting in Ansible
  ⌨️    Conditionals
  ⌨️    Privilege Escalation
  ⌨️    Ansible Configuration - Default Inventory File

LEARN MOST COMMON ANSIBLE MODULES WITH HANDS-ON DEMOS:
  ⌨️   Project: Deploy Nodejs Application
  ⌨️    Project: Deploy Nexus
  ⌨️    Configure servers with different Linux distributions on AWS and Digital Ocean platforms

💡  In these projects we will install tools on a server, configure applications, work with a file system, move static files between machines etc.
💡  Essentially you will learn how to map and translate shell scripts and commands into Ansible Playbooks to automate various common tasks in general.

MORE ADVANCED TOPICS & INTEGRATIONS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES:
  ⌨️   Dynamic Inventory for EC2 Servers
  ⌨️    Ansible Roles - to make your Ansible content more reusable and modular for better maintenance
  ⌨️    Project: Ansible & Terraform
  ⌨️    Project: Run Docker applications
  ⌨️    Project: Deploying Applications in Kubernetes
  ⌨️    Project: Run Ansible from Jenkins Pipeline

💡  So, you don't learn Ansible just as a standalone tool in this DevOps bootcamp, but rather integrated in different technologies, like Docker, K8s, Terraform, Jenkins, AWS and so on, in various real world use cases, as it builds on the previous modules in the bootcamp!

► Part of the DevOps Bootcamp 🚀  More infos here: https://bit.ly/3WwRuus

In this video I will give you a high-level overview of all the different container services you can use on AWS. If you want to run a containerized application on AWS you have multiple options, depending on your application requirements.

We will see what Elastic Container Service (ECS) is, what it's used for and how it works.
Then we will compare it and talk about EKS, which is Elastic Kubernetes Service.
We will also see different ways of running containers with EC2 or AWS Fargate.

And finally we will see the ECR Service, which stands for Elastic Container Registry.

In this GitHub Actions Tutorial we go through the following topics:
First I explain what GitHub Actions actually is and we will look at specific developer workflow use cases that you can automate with GitHub Actions .
After that I explain the basic concepts of GitHub Actions, including the GitHub Events and Actions and workflow and HOW GitHub Actions actually automates these workflows using these components.
Having understood what GitHub Actions solves and how it makes it possible, I will go through the most common workflow, which is CI/CD pipeline.
I will explain shortly why it is not just another ci/cd tool or what are the benefits of GitHub Actions ci cd pipeline.
Finally we will go through a hands-on DEMO, where I explain the syntax of github actions workflow file, and then I show you a complete ci pipeline setup with my example Java Gradle project, which we will build into a Docker Image and push to a private Docker repository on DockerHub.

►  Prometheus explained:  https://youtu.be/h4Sl21AKiDg
►  Demo Part 1: Setup Prometheus Monitoring on Kubernetes using Prometheus Operator:  https://youtu.be/QoDqxm7ybLc 
Demo Part 2: this video

In this Prometheus Monitoring Tutorial I show you how to monitor a third party application, like Mysql, Mongodb, Redis or any other service running in your Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus Monitoring.

I personally think this is a complex topic, simply because there are so many options and combinations of doing it and it’s also very badly documented. So it’s difficult to get a clear picture of how it works. And this is exactly what I want to address with this video. I will give you a good overview of all the different options and clear image of steps required to set up the monitoring. So no matter what application you have, you will know exactly how to configure its metrics collection for Prometheus.

And here is what we are gonna do:
* First we will deploy a Prometheus Operator in our Minikube cluster using a helm chart - this is a pretty easy step (Part 1 of demo!)
* Second we will deploy a MongoDB application as an example  
* and then we will configure our MongoDB application for Prometheus monitoring using a MongoDB exporter 

I explain all the concepts, including Exporter, ServiceMonitor and so on as we go through the setup. So you understand with every step exactly what we are doing.

Complete course on Udemy: Logging in Kubernetes with EFK Stack | The Complete Guide | NOTE: This video is part of above Udemy course

I designed this course to guide you step-by-step through a somewhat complex process of 
 1) setting up a k8s cluster from scratch, 
 2) deploying your own dockerized applications inside and 
 3) configuring a fully functioning logging inside the cluster using EFK stack.

So we’ll go through and learn the whole process end-2-end.

The individual steps we’ll go through and all the things you will learn in this compact course. 
►  We will create a k8s cluster from scratch on Linode cloud platform (with LKE) 
►  You will learn how to host your own docker images on a private repository and deploy them into k8s cluster
►  You will learn concepts of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and Fluentd 
►  as well as concepts of StatefulSet and DaemonSet components and Helm technology. 
►  After understanding all these concepts, we will deploy ElasticSearch (with data persistence ) , Kibana and Fluentd applications in k8s in an easy way using Helm charts
►  And finally we will configure collecting, processing and visualising the application logs

I explain all the concepts theoretically with simple animations and visuals, so that you understand how they work. And then we go through demo parts to set up these technologies, so that you also learn how to use them in practice. For that it’s of course important that you practice along with me. I have prepared a git repository with all the needed resources to follow along easier.

-------- What is EKS? -------- 
AWS EKS is a Managed Kubernetes Service from Amazon, which means AWS manages the Master Nodes for you. All the necessary applications/services are already pre-installed like the container runtime or master processes and in addition it also takes care of scaling and backups. 👍
You only create the Worker Nodes.

Learn about Master and Worker Nodes here: ► https://youtu.be/umXEmn3cMWY

--------  How to use EKS? -------- 
To create a K8s cluster in EKS you need to do following steps:
1) Setup or preparation steps
 - create AWS account
 - create a VPC - virtual private space
 - create an IAM role with Security Group (or in other words: create AWS user with list of permissions)
2) Create Cluster Control Plane - Master Nodes
 - choose basic information like cluster name and k8s version
 - choose region and VPC for your cluster
 - set security
3) Create Worker Nodes and connect to cluster
The Worker Nodes are some EC2 instances with CPU and storage resources.
 - Create as a Node Group
 - Choose cluster it will attach to
 - Define Security Group, select instance type etc.

With NodeGroup you have autoscaling, which means based on your needs depending on how much load the cluster has new Worker Nodes will automatically added or removed in the cluster.

 - For that you need to define max and minimum number of Nodes.

--------  Complex, but powerful and popular -------- 
You're right, that's a lot of effort for just creating a simple Kubernetes cluster. Compared to other managed Kubernetes services, like DigitalOcean or Linode it's more complex.

So, how to do it, when you just want to create a cluster and start deploying your containers inside as fast as possible. 

Instead of doing all those steps manually, there is a faster and more efficient way.

--------  eksctl to the rescue  -------- 
eksctl is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS. With just one command you create a cluster in minutes.
I'm a huge fan of understanding the concepts of how a technology works, but if there are tools that make working with this technology much easier then I like to use them. Usually those tools are built by community, which specialized in this technology. So it makes sense to use this knowledge.

So in the demo we will create the Kubernetes cluster using eksctl.

Terraform in detail         ►  https://youtu.be/l5k1ai_GBDE
Ansible in detail              ►  https://youtu.be/1id6ERvfozo

To understand the Infrastructure as Code concept better, I explain how DevOps tasks were done
 - before automation and
 - after automation.

Infrastructure as Code is a way to automate all these DevOps tasks end to end instead of doing it manually. All the knowledge and expertise of system administrators or DevOps engineers are packed into programs and applications that carry out those tasks.

So, Infrastructure as Code or IaC is a concept and there are Infrastructure as Code tools, like Ansible, Puppet, Terraform or Cloudformation etc  that you can use for different tasks.

Why do we have so many different tools, can't we just use one IaC tool? 🙄
Well, no. Because no tool can do everything and each one is good in a specific area. IaC tools automate tasks in different categories for different phases:

3 main task categories:
 1) infrastructure provisioning
 2) configuration of provisioned infrastructure
 3) deployment of application

Distinction of phases:
 1) initial setup phase
 2) maintaining phase

In most cases you would use a combination of 2 or more IaC tools.

476,ha3LjlD6g7g,TechWorld with Nana,Kubernetes Operator simply explained in 10 mins,"Kubernetes Operator explained | What are Kubernetes Operators and how it works
► Prometheus Operator in practice: https://youtu.be/QoDqxm7ybLc  🚀 

Learn what a Kubernetes Operator is, why this operator concept even emerged and why you should use Kubernetes Operators.

To give you an overview, operators are used mainly for stateful applications. So I first compare how Kubernetes manages stateless and stateful applications. And then compare deploying and managing stateful applications without an operator compared to deploying it with a Kubernetes Operator.

► 1. StateLESS applications on Kubernetes 🚀
Kubernetes can manage the complete lifecycle of stateless applications in a fully automated way, because these applications don’t have business logic for deployment.
So basically, once you deployed the application, you don’t have to sit there and control that your application is running properly.

► 2. StateFUL applications WITHOUT Operator 🤯
For stateful applications, like databases, the whole process isn’t as straightforward.
They need more ""hand-holding"" during its whole lifecycle, because the replicas of stateful apps aren't identical.

So, Kubernetes natively doesn’t have all the knowledge required 🤷🏻‍♂️  to automate the process of deploying every single stateful application. That’s why these kind of applications require manual intervention - people who ""operate"" these applications.

► 3. StateFUL applications WITH Operator 🦄
Operator solves this problem and basically replaces this ""human"" operator with a ""software"" operator.
At its core it has the same control loop mechanism that Kubernetes has, that watches for changes in the application state.
It also uses CRDs, which is basically a custom K8s component. So, it takes the basic Kubernetes resources and its controller concept as a foundation to build upon, and on top of that includes application-specific knowledge to automate the entire life cycle of the application it ""operates"".

In this Kubernetes Tutorial we go through a practical use case of deploying an application on a managed Kubernetes cluster using Linode Kubernetes Engine.

We will deploy a replicated database, configure its persistence and making it available with a UI client from browser using Ingress. We will also use Helm to make the process more efficient.

You will need this setup almost always for your Kubernetes cluster. No matter which database or cloud platform you use. So you can use the concept you learn in this video for many other use cases as well ✅

►  Follow along in this demo 🤓 👩🏻‍💻
All the source code is documented on Gitlab ►  https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/kubernetes-tutorial-series-youtube/-/tree/master/linode-kubernetes-engine-demo so you can follow along easily. 🙌🏼
1. Deploy replicated MongoDB (StatefulSet using Helm)
2. Configure Data Persistence for MongoDB (Linode Block Storage)
3. Deploy MongoExpress (Deployment and Service)
4. Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller as Loadbalancer (using Helm)
5. Configure Ingress rule

In detail we will deploy MongoDB on Linode Kubernetes Cluster using Helm (1.). We will create replicated MongoDB using StatefulSet component and configure data persistence for MongoDB with Linode's cloud storage (2.).

Then we will deploy a MongoExpress, a UI client, for MongoDB database to access it from the browser (3.). For this client we will configure NGINX Ingress Controller (4.). So we will deploy Ingress Controller in the cluster and configure Ingress rule to route the request to MongoExpress internal Service (5.).

In this video I talk about running Kubernetes on Cloud and the benefits of a Managed Kubernetes Service. I explain the option of an unmanaged (create your own cluster from scratch) vs managed Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform. 
Also I go through the topics of spinning up a cluster, making your web application available from the browser through a load balancer, how data persistence work in a managed Kubernetes cluster and the problem of migrating from one cloud platform to another (vendor lock-in).

There are so many tools and trends out there like Infrastructure as a Service, Kubernetes on Cloud or Managed Kubernetes Service etc, that have developed over the last few years, so it's good to get a good big picture overview of this. One of the known IaaS is Linode and I explain the mentioned topics with the example of Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE), but the concepts you learn can be used for any other cloud platform (e.g. AWS, Azure or Google Cloud) as well.

Learn how to setup Prometheus Monitoring and Grafana on Kubernetes cluster using Helm chart for Prometheus Operator

NOTE: Prometheus Operator shown in video is Deprecated. See the git repo for new operator installation and other relevant commands: 
https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/youtube-tutorial-series/-/blob/master/prometheus-exporter/install-prometheus-commands.md

Missed the theoretic part? Prometheus Architecture explained ► https://youtu.be/h4Sl21AKiDg
Demo Part 1: Setup Prometheus Monitoring with Helm chart for Prometheus Operator (this video) 
Demo Part 2: In the 2nd part we will actually configure Prometheus to expose /metrics endpoint and configure Prometheus to scrape it.  ►  https://youtu.be/mLPg49b33sA  🤓

In the demo I show you the third way. We will easily deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm chart for Prometheus Operator and I walk you through the different components, which were created. So that you have a good understanding 💡 of what they are and what they do.

Used versions in the demo:
► helm version: v3.2.1
► prometheus-operator: v0.38.1

In general there are 3 ways to do the setup:
1. Create all the configuration files yourself 👩🏻‍💻
This way is pretty inefficient and it's a lot of effort.
2. Using a Kubernetes Operator 😎
In this option you would go and find an operator for Prometheus and deploy it in the cluster using the configuration files of the operator. It is more efficient.
3. Using Helm chart to deploy the Prometheus Operator 🚀
This is the most efficient way. Prometheus Operator has a Helm chart that is maintained by the Helm community. You can use this Helm chart to deploy the operator.
So, Helm will do the initial setup. Operator will then manage the running Prometheus setup

Understand what Terraform is, its use cases, how it works and how it's different from Ansible 💡

Terraform is a tool for infrastructure provisioning to build out infrastructure through code, often called Infrastructure as Code. So, Terraform allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure, your platform and your services that run on that platform. It's open source and declarative, which means you define WHAT you want (the desired ""end state"") rather then describing exactly each step or HOW to do it.

In this tutorial you will learn what Terraform exactly is, Terraforms use cases or what it's used for, Terraforms Architecture and the basic commands. In addition I also clarify the question of what the difference of Terraform and Ansible is, because they seem to do the same thing.

Furthermore I also go one step deeper and explain what the terms and concepts of ""infrastructure provisioning"", ""infrastructure as code"" or ""declarative vs imperative"" mean. 💡

So, with this Terraform Tutorial you get a really good overview of what Terraform is, how Terraform works, how it does its job to get started quickly. 🙌🏼

► Subscribe To Me On Youtube: https://bit.ly/2z5rvTV

In this complete YAML tutorial you will learn what YAML is, what it's used for and I demonstrate the basic YAML syntax with real Kubernetes configuration files.

YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language and is a data serialization language. The basic building block of YAML documents are key-value pairs. Indentation is used to denote structure and tabs are not allowed.

In all my tutorial videos for Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible etc. I've used YAML for the example configuration files, because YAML has actually become a widely used format for writing configurations files. One of the reasons for its popularity is that the language is human-readable, intuitive and flexible. In fact, it can be used with nearly any application that needs to store or transmit data.

In this Yaml Tutorial I cover the below:

In this Kubernetes StatefulSet tutorial, I explain the difference between Deployment and StatefulSet. 
I also show you how to deploy databases using StatefulSet component.

Kubernetes StatefulSets are used to deploy specifically stateful applications. In order to understand how StatefulSet works, you first need to understand how database clusters work, as well concepts of Kubernets StatefulSet vs Deployment.

While StatefulSet is used for stateful applications, Deployment component is used to deploy stateless applications. So the question is: what is the difference between Deployment and StatefulSet components? 

Pods deployed by Deployment are identical and interchangeable, created in random order with random hashes in their Pod names. 
In contrast to that, the Pods deployed by StatefulSet component are NOT identical. They each have their own sticky identity, which they keep between restarts and each can be addressed individually. Thus, they can't be created or deleted at the same time or in any order.

How these identities are created and why its so important, I explain in detail in this video.

483,asIS4KIs40M,TechWorld with Nana,Pull Image from Private Docker Registry in Kubernetes cluster | Demo,"This video is a demo of deploying your application image from private docker registry hosted on AWS | Kubernetes pull image from private registry | Kubernetes Docker login

I answer the question of how to get your docker images in your kubernetes cluster from private docker registries? 
For images like Mongodb, elastic, that are hosted on docker hub, it’s straightforward because they are hosted in a public repository and anyone can access them. But your own application lives in a private repository and needs explicit access from the cluster.  So how do you pull the application images from your private docker repository on kubernetes cluster?

You do that using 2 steps:
 1) you create a secret component that contains access token/credentials to your docker registry.  
 2) you configure your Deployment component to use that secret using a specific imagePullSecrets.
In the video I show you exactly this.

► Subscribe To Me On Youtube: https://bit.ly/2z5rvTV

ConfigMap and Secret components are usually used for creating individual values, which are passed as environment variables in the pod configuration.
But ConfigMap and Secret are also volume types, which people don't realize in the beginning. Using them as volumes is actually a common requirement, e.g. think of applications that take configuration files as parameter on startup. Like prometheus, elastic search or your own java application taking a properties file or certificate file. The question is how to pass these config files to Kubernetes Pods?

In this video I show you how to create these configMap and secret volumes and how to use them in pods. I give you some real-life use cases and show you the syntax of using volumes in a pod configuration.

Kubernetes doesn't provide data persistence out of the box, which means when a pod is re-created, the data is gone. 
So, you need to create and configure the actual physical storage and manage it by yourself. Once configured, you can use that physical storage using Kubernetes storage components. In this video I show you 3 different Kubernetes volume components, that you need to use to connect the actual physical storage to your pod, so that the application inside the container can access it.

The 1st component ""Persistent Volume"" is a cluster resource, like CPU or RAM, which is created and provisioned by administrators. The 2nd component ""Persistent Volume Claim"" on the other hand is a user's or pod's request for a persistent volume. With the 3rd component ""Storage Class"" you can dynamically provision Persistent Volume component and so automate the storage provisioning process.

► Subscribe To Me On Youtube: https://bit.ly/2z5rvTV

In this video I cover one part of the broader Kubernetes Networking topic, which is container communication inside pods.
Considering Pods mostly contain only 1 main container, I start by answering the question of why having a Pod as an abstraction over container is such an important concept in Kubernetes.
I show how container port mapping is a problem with hundreds of containers, specifically how to allocate ports without getting conflicts. How this compares to Pods and how Pods solve this port allocation problem.
In addition, I show you in which cases you would need to run multiple containers in one pod and how these containers communicate with each other inside this pod.

❌ Correction for 6:15 in the video: Vagrant is NOT a container runtime alternative. K8s lists some of the alternatives here ► https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/.

▬▬▬▬▬▬  Complete Kubernetes Networking Course 🎬:
I'm making a complete course about Kubernetes Networking, covering rest of the topics, like 
► how pods communicate with each other on the same node and across hundreds of servers?
► how does the outside world communicate with K8s cluster?
► how K8s cluster plugs into the underlying infrastructure network?

► Subscribe To Me On Youtube: https://bit.ly/2z5rvTV

In this video I explain and show the 3 ways of how to write and execute your JavaScript code. I give a short demo of each and also explain the disadvantages of each.

 👩🏻‍💻 Where to write and execute JavaScript:
►  1) Writing and executing JavaScript directly in the Browser Console is the simplest way to get started. It's practical when you want to try something out, but not an option for real programming. Find out why in the video.
►  2) The second option writing JavaScript code in the index.html file (called inline script) is better, but has some disadvantages in structuring and keeping HTML/CSS apart from your logic.
►  3) The third and last way to write JavaScript code, is writing the code in a separate JavaScript file and linking this file in the HTML file. This is the way to go, because it is clean and practical when your application gets bigger.

 👩🏻‍💻 Simple Text Editor vs. Special Code Editor:
I also explain and show you the advantages of writing your JavaScript code in a special code editor instead of writing it in a simple text editor. One example is the highlighting of keywords or syntax error detection, which helps a lot in programming.

 👩🏻‍💻 Understand file structure in real projects and file path

I cover JavaScript's 5 data types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean, Array and Object, which I explain with simple examples to understand real life use cases of how these data types are useful in programming. 👩🏻‍💻
Variables is another very important concept in software development in general. Based on simple use cases you will understand what variables are and why you need them.

Some of the scenarios covered:
 - online shop
 - user input
 - social media websites

► Follow me on IG  for behind the scenes content 😊                   👉🏼   https://bit.ly/2F3LXYJ

Ansible is an automation tool for IT tasks. It is popular and widely accepted, because 1) it's usage of simple YAML language and 2) support for all types of infrastructure starting from Clouds to Virtual to bare metal servers.

In this video I explain examples of various IT tasks and how Ansible helps automate them to make daily DevOps tasks more efficient and less time consuming. 🙌🏼

I explain HOW Ansible does all this by going through its architecture:
 👉🏼 Ansible Modules (small programs that get executed on target machines)
 👉🏼 Ansible Playbook (instructions on HOW these programs get executed)
 👉🏼 Ansible Inventory (list of hosts, WHERE those programs gets executed)

In the end I also show how Ansible makes working with Docker more efficient and powerful and how it compares to similar automation tools like Puppet and Chef.

Usually in a production cluster setup you will have multiple master and worker nodes on separate machines. 💪🏼 But what if you want to test something on your local machine or try something out Setting up the whole cluster would be difficult or even impossible. 🤨

For that use case you can use *minikube*: a ONE Node cluster, where the master and worker processes are on the same machine.
*Kubectl*, the command line tool for Kubernetes, then enables the interaction with the cluster: to create pods, services and other components.

To deploy your application with Docker it must be packaged to it's own docker container. So, this means a docker image needs to be built from our JavaScript and Nodejs application and prepare it to be deployed on some environment. This will usually be done by an CD like Jenkins.
But in this video we will simulate what Jenkins does locally, building a docker image from our application locally.

► Subscribe to me on Youtube: https://bit.ly/2z5rvTV 

Docker Compose is a tool that makes running multiple Docker containers much easier, than with Docker run commands. I show you how docker run command compares to a docker compose file and explain step by step  the difference and how it maps from docker run to a docker compose field.

So, basically you can take the whole docker run command with it's configuration and map it into a file. You will get a more structured and re-usable command, especially if you have e.g. 10 docker containers.

The video begins with an overview of the three parts that make up the analysis. First, we create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called ""DepartmentStats."" This CTE calculates the standard deviation and average of salaries for each department, filtering out salaries below $10,000.

Moving on to part two, we create another CTE named ""DepartmentOutliers."" This CTE combines the ""Employee_Salaries"" table with ""DepartmentStats,"" enabling us to calculate the Z-scores for each salary. Z-scores help us determine how far a salary deviates from the department's average salary, taking into account the standard deviation. Again, we filter out salaries below $10,000.

Finally, we present the final query that provides valuable insights. We showcase the department, standard deviation, average, coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by average), and the count of outliers. By utilizing a left join, we ensure that all departments are included in the analysis, even if they have no outliers. The outlier count is determined by identifying salaries that have a Z-score greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96. The results are then grouped by department, standard deviation, average, and coefficient of variation, and sorted by department for clarity.","['data analyst', 'data scientist', 'data analytics', 'data science', 'business intelligence', 'computer science', 'data project', 'portfolio project', 'machine learning', 'python', 'data science project', 'data analytics project', 'data engineer', 'tableau', 'power bi', 'excel', 'sql', 'CTE', 'JOIN', 'subquery', 'sql project']",2023-06-02 13:15:10+00:00,3486,119,,19,PT17M1S,hd,false,Friday,0 days 00:17:01,21,34.136546184738954,5.4503729202524385,68

https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelimholland

In this tutorial, we show you how to use Python to optimize advertising budgets across different channels and find the ideal allocation that maximizes total sales. We start by fitting a linear regression model to the data and extracting the coefficients and intercept. We then define the objective function and the constraint function for the optimization problem, and use the minimize() function from the scipy.optimize library to solve the optimization problem and find the ideal allocation of the budget across the channels. 

Finally, we calculate the actual percentage for each channel contribution using the coefficients and the optimized percentages, and interpret the results in light of the data and the optimization problem. By combining linear regression and optimization techniques, we can make data-driven decisions that improve the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing strategies.

We all struggle to beautify our reports and dashboards. However, just like the technical skills needed to clean, model, and visualize data, design is a separate domain that takes years to master.  Learning concepts like color theory, visual hierarchy, and negative space that can instantly transform uninspired layout to something that is inspiring.

5 design tips that will help you improve your data visualizations

Layout – What is the objective of this design? How can the design be structure to instantly communicate to your specific audience?  Choosing  a  layout such as report layout, single visual or a dashboard. This will determine how the margins and the visuals will be structured on the canvas.

Visual Hierarchy – The visuals should flow from the order of importance so users can easily digest the information.

 Spacing – A cluttered visualization strains the eyes. Utilize negative space and alignment improves the overall design of the report.

 Color & Contrast – The use of color can be impactful or disruptive. Pick a color theme for the visualization to provide, contrast, branding, and significance. Use these resources for the best color scheme: https://color.adobe.com/create & for legibility: https://bit.ly/31vzjdl

 Details: Ensure that fonts and colors adhere to your theme and all spacing and alignment are finalized and have been measured equally. Details allow the user to not be distracted or focus on the information.

Binning or discretization is the process of transforming numerical variables into categorical counterparts. Numerical variables are usually discretized in the modeling methods based on frequency tables. Statistical data binning is a way to group numbers of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of ""bins"".

We will use the Pandas CUT function. This method  basically means that cut divide up the underlying data into equal-sized. or categorical bins. The function defines the bins using percentiles based on the distribution of the data, not the actual numeric edges of the bins.

Use sensitivity analysis to find how long before you before profitable on investment. Also, if you analyze to construct multiple scenarios with different variables and visualize it all in a conditional table.

A break-even analysis is a useful tool for determining at what point your company, or a new product or service, will be profitable. Put another way, it's a financial calculation used to determine the number of products or services you need to sell to at least cover your costs.

The break-even point formula is determined by dividing the total fixed costs associated with production by the revenue per individual unit minus the variable costs per unit. In this case, fixed costs refer to those which do not change depending upon the number of units sold.

Break-even analysis is an important aspect of a good business plan since it helps the business determine the cost structures and the number of units that need to be sold in order to cover the cost or make a profit.

The basic idea behind doing a break-even analysis is to calculate the point at which revenues begin to exceed costs. Examples of fixed costs include rent, insurance premiums, or loan payments. Variable costs are costs that change with the quantity of output. They are zero when production is zero.

If you have a put option, which allows you to sell your stock at a certain price, you calculate your breakeven point by subtracting your cost per share to the strike price of the option. The strike price on a put option represents the price at which you can sell the stock.

We discussed career options in the data field

Then we spoke about upcoming trends of 2024
Everyone got excited.

The moment we spoke about the scams
Everyone resonated.

Several people shared their experiences against scams like 100% job guarantee, fake masterclasses, and learning Power BI at 89 as they are directly impacted.

The biggest success of this event is many students, professionals, and delegates offered their support to reach this message to remote places of the country that the scamfluencers target the most.

Thanks everyone for attending this event both offline and online.

977,s6lRU0nn_nw,codebasics,Data Visualization Tip: Pie Chart vs Bar Chart 💡📊 #codebasics #shorts #dataanalysis #data,"Data visualization tip for the day.

We all love pie charts. They let you visualize how a part compares with the whole. But they become ineffective when the number of categories in a pie is more than a few. Things get worse when there is a dominating category suppressing smaller categories. It becomes hard to understand the position of smaller items and data labels suffocate in an unreadable crowded circular space.

A bar chart is a better choice in this case. Check the below visualization and let me know what you think!

In business, users cannot benefit from something that's fancy but not functional.

Example: Map visual is attractive but it is not best suited for a scenario where you need to show sales of multiple cities. A horizontal bar chart is the right option as it could show the city sales by rank and also give a better sense of comparison.

So remember to make your dashboard with functional visuals and add an attractive design on top of it for better user adoption. ✅

1175,HLU4oDOinzo,codebasics,What is Metaverse? Metaverse Career Opportunities,"Explain Metaverse as if I am 5 years old. In this video, I will provide a very simple explanation of Metaverse and also discuss career opportunities associated with it.

Metaverse is the future of the internet, the future of everything!” Many tech CEOs have quoted this in one or the other way. But what exactly is Metaverse? Watch this video to know everything you ever wanted to know about the future of the internet. In simple words, the metaverse is the next generation internet technology that is to improve the current 2D experience, by making it more realistic. How exactly does this happen? It is as simple as wearing a VRS headset. The next milestone of this will be a physical touch experience through the 3D world.

With this, our remote working style is much more likely to revolutionize and not be restricted to the 2D rectangular box. It won't be only restricted to the people of IT & software industry but also factory workers will be able to enjoy the privilege of working from home. With this, the remote working culture will be in boom and thus allowing people from lower opportunity regions to get hired across the world.

Also, the boom of the metaverse is likely to bring in many career opportunities. With the possible evolution of metaverse apps, the demand for metaverse app developers is also likely to be increasing. Following this, the career opportunities for blockchain developers and cyber security engineers are also likely to have a hike. When talking about creating real life in the digital world, the role of a digital artist is inevitable. Data scientists, data analysts, and ML engineers are going to be in huge demand, given the fact that there will be a lot of data created and an ever-growing demand for applying AI and data science on various use cases. Metaverse is going to build a great platform for educational creators, who can then be able to conduct 3D live virtual classes.

However, with the good comes a bad part too. Keep watching this video to know about the possible negative impacts of the metaverse. Note, these are only my point of view. Metaverse is a rising wave and we have to either learn to fight it or surf through it.

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Tableau can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning. Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc. In this video, we will classify flower images and see how our cnn model overfits. After that we will use data augmentation to generate new training samples and see how model performance improves.

Insertion sort requires many swaps and comparisons if heavy elements are located towards the end of an array. Shell sort will initially sort subarrays that are equal distance apart. The distance here is referred to as a gap. We will than keep on reducing the gap until it is 1. With gap=1 it becomes insertion sort but this time due to optimization we have performed earlier, sorting the array would require very less  comparisons and element swaps.

To be a successful python programmer, the most basic requirement is python knowledge. Your skill level doesn't matter, because you can keep upgrading yourself. Followed by this, a strong data structure and algorithm foundation is a must. This allows you to write better and compact programs. Don't forget to sharpen your debugging skills, and remember to use libraries wisely. PEP8 & coding best practices will aid you in writing readable code. It is always advisable to contribute to open source and review codes. Through this, you get a chance to interact with experts, and you can improvise on your skills with their guide. While learning python, never be ashamed to ask for help. But understand, it is important to ask the right question. If you misinterpret the question, you would be led nowhere. The last but most important step in the python developer roadmap is- Projects! Practice more and more projects to improve your python programming skills. 
Without these skills, you might be able to write a python program that would function, but with these, you can write an efficient one.

Tensorboard is a tool that comes with tensorflow and it allows you to visualize neural network as well as how it trains itself. This tool is very helpful in debugging issues too. We will use the notebook that we created in previous videos for recognizing handwritten digits and visualize accuracy,loss with every epoch using tensorboard. We will also look at the visual graphs of neural network along with some internal computations.

Software architecture blog: https://martinfowler.com/
Competitive coding websites: leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks, careercup

1. Making initial conversation on resume effective
 1.1) Mention only those things on resume that you feel comfortable talking about, for projects that you mentioned on resume you should be able to draw tech arch diagram and talk through various business as well as technical aspects. Like why did you choose given architecture, No SQL vs SQL etc
  - Fresher: college projects
  - Experienced: Projects in past companies
 1.2) Why did you apply in our company? Say you applied in blackhawknetwork, they will ask you ""why blackhawknetwork?"". To respond to this question you need to know about company's products, clients and culture. You can use following resources to gain this knowledge,
  - Company's website, Google
  - Glassdoor
  - Linkedin: Connect with people working in that company 
 1.3) Tell something about yourself
  - Mention your passions any achievements (like opensource contributions, any achievements in projects)

2. Master competitive coding
 2.1) You can use these websites for practice: leetcode, careercup, geeksforgeek, glassdoor
 2.2) Don't make assumptions, ask smart counter questions. They want to check given a vague requirement how can you dig the details and transition from vague to concrete
 2.3) Data structure: Same problem can be solved using two different data structure but one DS might be more efficient than others
 2.4) Clean and effective coding
  - proper variable, class names 
  - modularize code using functions,classes
  - compact coding (use code review guidelines github page)
 
3. Mastering questions related to data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, design
 3.1) Again refer to glassdoor, careercup, leetcode for questions
 3.2) Experienced programmer: design questions 
  - Design messenger
  - Design facebook
  - This will cover things such as overall system design, databases, caching, scalability, class design, distributed computing
 
4. Communication, confidence and body language
 4.1) Be confident, don't have a guilt if you answer something wrong
 4.2) If you don't know about some topic be honest and say I've not worked on Redis but I know about cache little bit and I am ready to learn

5. Asking smart questions on the role and the company
 - What tech stack do you use in your team and in the company in general?
 - What type of problems your company or your team solves? 
 - What are growth and learning opportunities?
 - Will I get a chance to contribute to open source?
 - Which team you are working on and do you enjoy working here and why?
 - What are some of the good aspects of working here?

Now just a disclaimer, in order to learn deep learning you don't need to have such an expensive setup. Whatever laptop or personal computer you have should still work ok. If you have a requirements for running heavy jobs, you can utilize cloud for that. For me, NVIDIA gave 2500$ Titan RTX GPU for free and than I spent close to 1000$ for other parts to build this PC. My plan is to run some heavy deep learning jobs on this computer and I will be making videos on that in future. 
Special thanks to my nephew (Harsh Patel) who helped me a lot during entire PC build process. Thanks Harsh! :)

In this video we will see a very simple explanation of what a gradient descent is for a neural network or a logistic regression (remember logistic regression is a very simple single neuron neural network). We will than implement gradient descent from scratch in python.
In my machine learning tutorial series I already have a video on gradient descent but that one is on linear regression whereas this video is for logistic regression for neural network. Here is the link of my linear regression GD video,

We will use insurance dataset as a sample and build a logistic regression. Logistic regression uses two step process for classification,
step 1: linear regression to find best fit line for given dataset
step 2: sigmoid or logit function to convert this line into values between 0 and 1
Using sigmoid function one can do a classification.

In this deep learning tutorial python, I will cover following things in this video,
00:00 Introduction 
00:24 Data growth
01:25 Hardware advancements
02:40 Python and opensource ecosystem
04:00 Cloud and AI boom

I remember I did a project in my college 17 years ago and implemented error backpropogation algorithm in C++. Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don't know programming and they can  try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn't need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.

In the video comment below, please post two types of feedback,
1) What questions or insights this report is generating for you? For example revenues from Electricsara stores clients are declining. So maybe we need to engage more with this client and try to figure out a way to increase our sales (maybe give them a special discount)
2) Say you are a sales director of Atliq hardware and now you started using this dashboard. What improvements do you want to make in this? For example, I want to see a pie chart of revenues from the top 5 clients.

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

1438,xucm6_BQPJU,codebasics,Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science,"Artificial intelligence is a field where set of techniques are used to make computers as smart as humans. There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. 
Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

We will then use GridSearchCV and try different models with different hyper parameters to come up with a best model that can give us maximum accuracy. We will use sklearn classification_report to check the performance. Once we select best model based on GridSearchCV we can evaluate it on X_test and y_test to get a feel of how it is going to perform in production. Confusion matrix is used with seaborn visualization to get an understanding of classification errors for each of the classes. In the end we export the model to a file using joblib.

We mostly identify a person in a photo with a face. Hence we will use opencv and a technique called haar cascades to detect if a face and two eyes are clearly visible or not. If they are than we keep the image otherwise we discard the image. Majority of the data cleaning work will be done using python code but there will be some cleaning work that we will have to do manually.

1451,pOXmn7jP9gQ,codebasics,Is Becoming a Data Scientist Hard?,"HBR named data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself ""have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?"" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources,
Great resources to learn math:
https://www.mathsisfun.com/
https://www.khanacademy.org/
3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw

Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily,
Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

The formula for IQR is very simple. IQR = Q3-Q1. Where Q3 is 75th percentile and Q1 is 25th percentile. Once you have IQR you can find upper and lower limit by removing this formula,
lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_limit = Q3 +1.5*IQR
Anything less than a lower limit or above the upper limit is considered outlier. We will use python pandas to remove outliers on a sample dataset and in the end, as usual, I have an interesting exercise for you to practice

We will look at 3 different cases where a node you are deleting is a leaf node, or it has only one child or it has two children. We can handle deletion in different ways in these cases. We will implement node deletion in python and in the end there will be an exercise that you can practice your skills on.

They are useful in implementing set/map class in different programming languages. They provide efficient way of search an element in log n complexity. There are various traversal schemes you can use such as breadth first search and depth first search. In depth first search you can use in order traversal, pre order traversal and post order traversal schemes that will benefit in different scenarious. For example  in order traversal gives you a sorted list of elements in a tree. After going through theory we will implement binary tree, rather binary search tree in python. Binary search tree is also known as BST that is basically a binary tree with some order of elements.

One can not become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures. This is the reason, interviewers ask data structure questions in any programming interview. They store data in a specific memory layout and based on what type of problem you are solving it might become necessary to use one data structure versus the other. The few most common data structures are array, linked list, tree, stack, queue, etc. In this video, we will understand what data structures are and their implementations in different programming languages.

1483,IR_S8BC8KI0,codebasics,Big O notation - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial #2 | Measuring time complexity,"Big O notation is the way to measure how software program's running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. We can't measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants. Big O is used to measure space complexity as well, You will know how to find the time and space complexity of algorithms.

Clarification: At 5:05, the code should be print(str(numbers[i]) + "" is a duplicate""), to concatenate integer with string you need to convert to string or use format string.

1490,q9oAZwhuUy4,codebasics,Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist,"Want to know the difference between Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist? Keep watching this video to know. Data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer are three different roles in the field of data science and data analytics. And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. 
A data engineer is a software engineer who specializes in data-based technology and is well versed in extracting data from structured and unstructured sources. A data analyst is a person who has domain knowledge, while the data scientist has all the skillset like an analyst, but is also good at statistics and knows deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing. The difference between data analyst vs data scientist, is the expertise in statics. 
A short summary of the difference is that a data engineer is like a raw material you need to prepare any dish, while the data scientist or analyst is the chef who can make the dish.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

In this particular video we will load banglore home prices data into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values. We will than removal some unnecessary features and also normalize property size. We will convert the range of property size (such as 2100-3250) into an average of min and max.

Data science is a process of getting insights from data. You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as,

#DataScience #WhatIsDataScience #DataScienceForBeginners #DataScientist #DataScienceTutorial #DataScienceWithPython #DataScienceCourse

1) Apache hadoop and apache spark: For database storage and distributed computing
2) Python and R: For data science programming
3) Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebook: For data visualization
4) Sklearn, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, PyTorch: For deep learning and machine learning

Data scientist has become the most popular job in the market today and there is a huge career scope if you know how to do data science. Some of the use cases of data science in real life are,

1) Healthcare: Diagnostic prediction and accuracy
2) Finance: Fraud detection, predictive analysis on loans, stock market movement, company future
3) Shipping: Figure out best route for shipping 
4) E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory pricing

1500,HdlDYng8g9s,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 16: Hyper parameter Tuning (GridSearchCV),"In this python machine learning tutorial for beginners we will look into,
1) how to hyper tune machine learning model paramers 
2) choose best model for given machine learning problem
We will start by comparing traditional train_test_split approach with k fold cross validation. Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV
but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV. In the end we have interesting exercise for you to solve.

1501,nHIUYwN-5rM,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 15:  Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm Part 2,"In this python machine learning tutorial for beginners we will build email spam classifier using naive bayes algorithm. We will use sklearn CountVectorizer to convert email text into a matrix of numbers and then use sklearn MultinomialNB classifier to train our model. The model score
with this approach comes out to be very high (around 98%). Sklearn pipeline allows us to handle pre processing transformations easily with its convenient api. In the end there is an exercise where you need to classify sklearn wine dataset using naive bayes.

Naive bayes theorm uses bayes theorm for conditional probability with a naive assumption that the features are not correlated to each other and tries to find conditional probability of target variable given the probabilities of features. We will use titanic survival dataset here and using naive bayes classifier find out the survival probability of titanic travellers. We use sklearn library and python for this beginners machine learning tutorial. GaussianNB is the classifier we use to train our model. There are other classifiers such as MultinomialNB but we will use that in part 2 of the tutorial.

1541,9yl6-HEY7_s,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 6: Dummy Variables & One Hot Encoding,"Machine learning models work very well for dataset having only numbers. But how do we handle text information in dataset? Simple approach is to use interger or label encoding but when categorical variables are nominal, using simple label encoding can be problematic. One hot encoding is the technique that can help in this situation. In this tutorial, we will use pandas get_dummies method to create dummy variables that allows us to perform one hot encoding on given dataset. Alternatively we can use sklearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder as well to create dummy variables.

1542,KfnhNlD8WZI,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 5: Save Model Using Joblib And Pickle,"Training machine learning model can be quite time consuming if training dataset is very big. In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

1569,eykoKxsYtow,codebasics,Why Should You Learn Python? | Complete python3 tutorials for beginners,"Python tutorial for beginners: In this tutorial we will learn why everyone should learn python. If you are a beginner and just starting out with programming then python is probably the best place to start. Also for experienced programmers, it makes sense to learn python programming because code development speed is very good and one can to fast prototyping. Python is used heavily in data science, machine learning, scientific computing due to its rich set of libraries (modules). So come and learn python with me :)

Topics that are covered in this Video:
0:00 Introduction 
0:08 It is easy to learn and very intuitive programming language
1:02 You can develop code really fast in python whereas with other languages it takes relatively longer time. This is so because,
   * The code syntax is compact
   * There is no compilation. Python is interpreted language so you save time on compiling the code.
   * It has rich set of libraries so for pretty much anything you can just import a library, write couple of lines using that and you are done
2:45 Rich set of libraries or modules
3:24 Used heavily in the fields of data science, machine learning and scientific computing
3:52 Plenty of job opportunities
