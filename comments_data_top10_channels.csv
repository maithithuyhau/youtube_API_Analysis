I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform. This way it'll take much less time to refresh the memory and you'll have more cycles to access to the memory.

It has been 80 years and there haven't been a single use of nuclear weapons so far. There are many brilliant minds and also governments already working on this initiative of AI regulation. If controlled some of the downsides of AI such as AI taking control over humanity etc can be minimized.

Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

Mb someone can be intersted and this will be helpful, also i could made some mistakes, but i think someone will notice it)\r\n\r\nNLP pipeline ‚Äì is a series of steps recurred to make a NLP application that transform raw text data into a desired output, such as a label, a summary, or a response. \r\nLabel: In NLP, a label typically refers to a categorical or descriptive tag assigned to a piece of text or a dataset to categorize or classify it. Labels are often used in supervised machine learning tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis, where texts are assigned specific predefined categories or classes. For instance, in sentiment analysis, labels could be ""positive,"" ""negative,"" or ""neutral,"" representing the sentiment conveyed in a text.\r\nSummary: A summary in NLP refers to a condensed version of a longer text or document, capturing the main points, ideas, or key information while retaining the essence of the original content. Summarization tasks can be extractive (selecting and combining important sentences or phrases from the original text) or abstractive (generating new sentences that convey the main ideas).\r\nResponse: In an NLP context, a response is often used in dialogue systems or chatbots where the system generates or provides an answer or reply to a user query or input. The response is the output generated by the system based on its understanding of the input text or context. It could be a straightforward answer, an explanation, or any relevant information provided by the system.\r\n\r\nFirst step in NLP pipeline is data Acquisition to get necessary data required to solve a NLP problem.\r\nFor data Acquisition u can use public data set or product interventions, or web scrapping, data augmentations, etc.\n\r\nSecond step is Extraction n Cleanups such as discard irrelevant information, creating simple version of ur text data, spell corrections, // removing\n\r\nThird step is Preprocessing include\r\n_sentence tokenization (NLT, spyCy)\r\n_words tokenization\r\n_Stemming ‚Äì reducing a word to it base exmp. loved, loves, loving ‚Äì love, no grammar\r\n_Lemmatization ‚Äì reducing a word to it base WORD ate, eating ‚Äì eat\r\n \r\nFourth step is converting words into numbers Feature Engineering, here some techniques\r\n\r\nN-grams: Creating features by considering sequences of words or characters together, known as n-grams (uni-grams for single words, bi-grams for pairs of words, tri-grams for triplets, etc.). This captures more contextual information.\r\nBag-of-Words (BoW): Representing text data as a vector of word counts or frequencies in a document. Each unique word in the vocabulary becomes a feature, and the count/frequency of each word becomes the feature value.\r\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Similar to BoW, TF-IDF represents text data as numerical vectors, but it weighs the importance of words by considering their frequency in a specific document relative to their frequency in the entire corpus.\r\n\r\nFifth step Model Building with Machine learning (not always)\r\nModel building in NLP refers to the process of constructing, training, and refining machine learning or deep learning models to perform specific natural language processing tasks. This process involves several key steps:\r\nModel Selection: Choosing the appropriate architecture or model type that fits the specific NLP task. For instance, for text classification, models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or Transformer-based architectures might be considered.\r\n\r\nTraining: Utilizing the prepared dataset to train the selected model. During training, the model learns to understand the patterns and relationships within the data, adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual labels.\r\n\r\nHyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting model hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc.) to optimize the model\'s performance. This process often involves experimentation and validation on a separate dataset (validation set) to prevent overfitting.\r\nSixth step is Evaluation.\r\nEvaluation in NLP refers to the process of assessing the performance, accuracy, and effectiveness of natural language processing models, algorithms, or systems. It involves measuring how well a particular NLP task or model accomplishes its intended objectives.\r\n\r\nEvaluation in NLP can take several forms depending on the specific task being evaluated. Some common evaluation metrics and methodologies used in NLP include:\r\n\r\nAccuracy: This metric measures the overall correctness of a model\'s predictions or classifications compared to the true labels or expected outputs.\r\nPrecision and Recall: These metrics are commonly used in tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, and named entity recognition. Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant instances in the data.\r\nF1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is often used in scenarios where both precision and recall are important and need to be balanced.\r\nBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): BLEU is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to one or more human-generated reference translations.\r\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): ROUGE is a set of metrics used for evaluating text summarization systems by comparing the generated summary to one or more reference summaries created by humans.\r\nPerplexity: This metric is often used to evaluate language models by measuring how well a model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance.\r\nHuman Evaluation: Sometimes, the most accurate evaluation involves human judgment. Human evaluators can assess the quality, coherence, and relevance of generated text, translations, or summaries.\r\nCross-Validation: It\'s a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to new, unseen data by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets for training and evaluation.\r\nEvaluation in NLP is crucial to understand how well a model performs on a given task, to compare different models or techniques, and to iteratively improve the performance of NLP systems. The choice of evaluation metric often depends on the specific NLP task and the goals of the project.\r\n\r\nSeventh step is Deployment\r\nWhen model is built, u can export it a file and deploy it on the cloud (Google, Azure, AWS, etc.) or write FastAPI based or Flask service around that model and deploy that service in the cloud. Also u can deploy to an end-to-end ML (Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, H2O.a, databricks, etc.)\r\nEight step is Monitor n Update', 'Thanks so much!', 'I have studied for a whole semester to understand what you taught.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]"

Machine learning course of skillsbasics solve the same use case though their algorithms to make predictions on the same. So on whole what i mean is let us take an idea as a use case and implies various technologies on the same and give the real world use case as a package to the learner of the course. From learner's perspective, more than learning a technology, it will be like reading a story book, which will also walk him through the technologies as well encouraging him to think about helping the people of the world by addressing real world common problems of them.\n\nAnd I strongly possess learning technologies will do nothing unless we apply it to solve the problem of common people through it.
